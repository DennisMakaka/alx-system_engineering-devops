# **Postmortem: Incident of User Privilege Mismanagement**

---

## **Issue Summary**
- **Outage Duration:**  
  **Start:** August 17, 2024, 5:00 PM EAT  
  **End:** August 17, 2024, 6:15 PM EAT

- **Impact:**  
  A Bash script intended to run commands under a specified user inadvertently deleted essential system files, disrupting key services. Approximately 75% of users faced authentication failures and restricted access to resources.

- **Root Cause:**  
![SUDU vulnerabilities](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5612AQEg1U6lo1e7vw/article-cover_image-shrink_600_2000/0/1612483551876?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=nihG-vXFyaaD7K9ZgIW8ubWkfVLLFGAkCSjdXYaWpB4)
  
The root cause was the improper handling of administrative privileges within the Bash script. The script allowed unrestricted use of the `sudo` command without validation, leading to the execution of potentially harmful commands under root privileges. This lack of safeguards resulted in the unintentional deletion of critical system files.

## **Timeline**
- **5:05 PM:** Monitoring alerts indicated a significant drop in system performance.
- **5:10 PM:** Surge in authentication errors observed by the system administrator.
- **5:15 PM:** Engineering team began investigating the Bash script suspected of causing the issue.
- **5:30 PM:** Initial focus was on potential permission misconfigurations.
- **5:45 PM:** Misleading paths around user permissions prolonged the resolution.
- **6:00 PM:** DevOps team escalated for a deeper review of the script and logs.
- **6:10 PM:** Identified misuse of `sudo` within the script as the root cause.
- **6:15 PM:** Issue resolved by updating the script and restoring the system.

## **Root Cause and Resolution**
- **Root Cause:**  
  The incident was caused by a Bash script's misuse of the `sudo` command, which allowed broad execution of commands under root privileges without proper validation. This resulted in the unintentional deletion of critical system files. The scriptâ€™s design lacked adequate safeguards, such as input validation and command whitelisting, leading to the incident.

- **Resolution:**  
  The resolution involved revising the script to incorporate strict validation mechanisms, ensuring only safe, predefined commands could be executed using `sudo`. Additionally, the script was updated to reject or flag any commands that might compromise system integrity. After implementing these changes, the system was restored from a stable backup, and affected services were reconfigured to resume normal operation.

## **Corrective and Preventative Measures**
- **Improvements:**  
  Strengthen script execution processes with enhanced safety checks, and increase awareness of the risks associated with elevated privilege operations.

- **Tasks:**
  1. Enforce strict validation checks in the Bash script.
  2. Mandate non-root user accounts for script execution, unless absolutely necessary.
  3. Implement logging and alerting for potentially dangerous commands.
  4. Provide training on secure scripting practices, emphasizing proper use of `sudo`.
  5. Regularly audit and update automation scripts for security compliance.
