# Networking basics
 - The "Networking Basics" project is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of fundamental networking concepts and practices within the context of DevOps. This project aims to equip learners with essential knowledge and skills related to networking, enabling them to navigate and contribute effectively in DevOps environments.

## Learning objectives
 - By the end of this project, participants are expected to:

1. Understand the OSI Model:

2. Explain the seven layers of the OSI model, their functions, and how they contribute to network communication.
Comprehend Local and Wide Area Networks (LANs/WANs):

3. Define LANs and WANs, including their typical usage, geographical sizes, and roles in networking infrastructure.
Grasp Internet and IP Address Concepts:

4. Define the Internet and understand the significance of IP addresses. Differentiate between IPv4 and IPv6.
Explore TCP and UDP Protocols:

5. Identify and explain the roles of TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) in data transfer.
Master Port and Protocol Knowledge:

6. Understand the concept of ports and memorize key port numbers for SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS.
Dive into Localhost, Subnetting, and IPv6 Adoption:

7. Explain the purpose of localhost, subnetting, and why IPv6 was introduced to address IPv4 limitations.
Gain Practical Skills:

8.  Develop hands-on skills by writing Bash scripts related to networking basics. This includes creating scripts for network checks, port scanning, and other relevant tasks.

## Project Structure
###Bash Scripts
 - Implement Bash scripts adhering to best practices and project requirements.

### Documentation
 - Maintain a well-structured README.md file providing information on how to use the scripts, the project's file structure, installation steps, and other relevant details.

## Requirements
 - Ensure compliance with project requirements, including the use of specific editors (vi, vim, emacs), interpretation on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, and adherence to coding standards.

###Additioal note
 - This project serves as a foundational step for individuals aiming to strengthen their networking knowledge in the context of DevOps, facilitating a smoother integration of networking principles into their professional skill set.
